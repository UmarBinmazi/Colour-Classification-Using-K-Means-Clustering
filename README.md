An interactive web app to detect **dominant colors** in an image using **K-Means Clustering**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- ðŸ“¤ Upload any image
- ðŸŽ¯ Detect dominant colors using **K-Means Clustering**
- ðŸ“Š View:
  - Closest CSS3 color names
  - Hex codes
  - Color usage percentages

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. Image is resized and preprocessed.
2. **K-Means Clustering** groups pixels into color clusters.
3. Optimal number of clusters is chosen using the **elbow method**.
4. Each cluster center is:
   - Converted to hexadecimal
   - Mapped to the nearest CSS3 color name
   - Calculated for percentage share in the image

---

## ðŸ“¸ Example Use Case

Upload a photo of a **sunset**, and the app will return dominant colors like:
- ðŸŸ  Orange
- ðŸ’— Pink
- ðŸ’œ Purple  
with their **hex codes** and **percentages** in the image.
